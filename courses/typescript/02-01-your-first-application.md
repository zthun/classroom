# Your First Application

In this chapter, we are going to be writing the "Hello World" application. This application, by far, serves no purpose at all and provides no real world application of how to do anything in programming. It has one main focus and one focus only.

> The purpose of Hello World in all languages is not to teach you anything overwhelmingly valuable about the language. **It serves to show you the skeleton you need of where the application enters and where it exits.** It also shows the basic technique to display output to the user.

## Setting Up

For the remainder of the tutorial, we are going to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as our IDE. If you are using another IDE editor, such as Atom, you will need to install the given plugins for TypeScript development. If you are using Replit or some other ODE, you should be good to go out of box.

If you want to follow along with this, run the following commands.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zthun/claszroom
cd claszroom/samples/typescript/hello-world
npm ci
npm start
```
