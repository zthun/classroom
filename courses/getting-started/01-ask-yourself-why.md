# Ask Yourself Why?

Have you ever wondered why you are doing the things you do? Is it because your boss or teacher gave you an assignment? Or have you had an immediate problem that required a quick solution? These situations happen all of the time. What's interesting is we, as human beings, tend to not question the rules of authority, and it's not surprising that this is the standard. Ever since grade school, we are told "I'm the boss; you do what I say" from our parents and teachers. This strategy tends to work very well with children. [Children's brains are not fully developed for abstract thought, and the full reasoning for this type of thinking does not occur in children until the ages of 11-16](https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/psychpedia/abstract-thinking). However, once we reach the age of reasoning and thought, we can comprehend more abstractions and thus, we begin to question more.

However, throughout my life, I have noticed two flavors of answers to the question "why," which rank among the worst: "Because such and such said so," and "It's just always what we've done." The first answer is offensive. You are an underdeveloped child, you must be told what to do, and you must not question the status quo. The second answer is one of laziness. You do not care about the output and are disengaged from the activity itself.

Both of these answers are terrible. They give no meaning to the actions you're taking; they're offensive and are nothing more than fear based responses. The first is the fear of retaliation. If I question you, are you going to fire me, suspend me, murder me, or do something that is relatively unpleasant? The action or project may get completed, but the quality may suffer, bandages may be applied, shortcuts may be taken, and relationships may be shattered. The second is the fear of change. Inflicting punishment on yourself when you know there's a better way to do something is just kicking the can down the road and creating a bigger problem to solve in the future. Piling trash on top of trash just creates a bigger trash pile.

I'm certain that everyone everywhere can think of specific examples of terrible answers to the question "why?"

## Example: Taking the HIPAA Training

![HIPAA](../../media/jpeg/hipaa-256x256.jpg)

One day, I was taking [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html) training for a company that I just got hired at. If you are unaware, HIPAA stands for the [_Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act_ that was signed into law in 1996](https://www.hipaaguide.net/hipaa-for-dummies/). Whenever you take training for a company, you are almost sure to come across this training which deals with people's privacy regarding medical information. HIPAA training isn't exactly exciting. You listen to a bunch of instructors giving generic, almost common sense, information through a series of videos with mandatory quizzes at the end. If you pass the quizzes, you move on to the next module; if you fail, you must retake the quiz or refresh the information until you successfully pass.

I was going through one of the quizzes and was answering all of the questions correctly until I came to an interesting multiple choice query with 4 possible answers. I considered this question the most impactful and significant question to the entire training.

**Why is it necessary for our company to follow the policies of HIPAA?**

The possible answers were all obviously generic and most of them were obviously wrong, but what was interesting was the accepted answer.

**Because it is enforced by the federal government and we will receive fines for not following the policy.**

Now, I don't know about you, but I actually had to sit back in my chair with my mouth hanging towards the floor. This was an abysmal answer to this question. The language used here basically translates to a fear based response. The authority over us has directly told us to do this, without telling us why, and we must comply, by force, or receive severe punishments. It's understandable that a company does not want to be punished with fines; lawsuits are not fun. Touching the hot stove comes with a learning experience in itself. However, using this as the primary motivator masks the real reason as to why complying with HIPAA is important. This answer just makes you resent the policy, and is terrible.

The true answer to this question, and the real meaning of why this is necessary is made explicit by [HHS](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/faq/188/why-is-the-privacy-rule-needed/index.html). In short, the reason to comply with HIPAA is to **protect the private health information of patients, so that said information cannot be used by malicious parties when making crucial decisions that affect the patients life and well being**. For example, if a patient's health information was passed on to a bank lender, said bank lender may deny applications to a mortgage or credit card. Abusive employers may terminate an employee because of lifestyle disagreements which do not pertain to the job duties of said employee.

The response to the question of why given by HHS is a fantastic answer. It gives a real reasoning behind the question; it creates an almost super hero like passion to enforce the compliance of the policy, and most importantly, it relates to the people that it is trying to protect. The question of why is a question of **intent** and **purpose**. It is not a question of authority. Good answers make you think; bad answers make you afraid.

## Putting It Together

Throughout all courses in Claszroom, you will see patterns, designs, and techniques that have not only been innovated over decades, but are often considered industry best practices. You may also see and read things that seem off base and are not standard. This is on purpose. Claszroom is an ever evolving document that will change with the times based on research, considerations, and personal experience.

> Many times you will see designs, you will also see an accompanying blockquote. The blockquote describes the reason why we are doing what we are doing. All answers to these questions will always attempt to be a non fear based, good answer. Whether or not you accept the answer or its reasoning, you will have to decide that for yourself. Feel free to discuss the issue under the Issues tab in Github.

With this in mind, not every line, statement, pattern, or design may come with a blockquote reason. For some of the course material, you will have to figure out why for yourself. If you feel there is a good reason for doing something, and you think that the reason is missing from the document, then please feel free to do a pull request and add the necessary information. As long as you have a reason for doing what you're doing, that will create more meaningful impact to your everyday work when writing code. I encourage you to watch this fantastic [presentation by Simon Sinek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuA&ab_channel=TEDxTalks) which changed my world view on many issues. It is the structural foundation for my everyday activities, and I encourage others to think about the why. If you are unsure, ask. Asking questions is at the core of education and it is better in the long run to feel a bit foolish and educated than to feel popular and ignorant. If we were in a room full of people and you asked a question of why are we doing this, I can bet my entire Batman comic book collection that someone else in the room has the same question but they may be too afraid to ask. Be the leader. Ask why.

In the reverse sense, it is also possible you are being asked why on your position. If you are unsure, don't use fear or laziness as an answer. A perfectly acceptable answer is "I don't know." I don't know gets others to think and discuss. I don't know is what raises curiosity. If you are going down a path and you find out you are just going through the motions, ask yourself why you are doing what you're doing and be ok with an answer of "I don't know." This will get you to think about the real answer and may prompt you to slow down, and research the potential results of your work.

## So Why Claszroom?

Today's college and education system is broken. The average cost of tuition in the US is [an outrageous $26000 per academic year as of 2021](https://educationdata.org/average-cost-of-college). The total amount of student debt [is over 1.7 trillion dollars](https://studentloanhero.com/student-loan-debt-statistics/). Is this what it's come to? A lifetime of slavery to debt collectors for an education.

We're watching a train wreck in extreme slow motion. Why go to college? I'll bet the overwhelming answer that most people have in their heads is one of two possibilities. Either they want an education to get a good job, or that's just what you do after high school. Notice how familiar the second answer sounds? It's the lazy answer and generally in the category of bad reasons. The first answer is a better reasoning, but I will challenge it with another problem. Software development is a moving target. If you get out of college, chances are, the information you spent four to five years learning will be out of date and you will have to re-educate yourself on the latest technology. College is great for theory and general practices, but it's horrible for keeping you up to speed.

Coding bootcamps have become a thing for many people who are trying to break into the software industry. I've worked with several people who have gone through these short, one to three month, bootcamps and often, they come out of the gate without a knowledge of how to write a for loop or use the debugger. Yet, for the short three months, they can cost an [enormous $13000](https://www.coursereport.com/blog/coding-bootcamp-cost-comparison-full-stack-immersives#:~:text=While%20the%20average%20full%2Dtime,deferred%20tuition%20or%20offer%20ISAs). Yet, even if you decide to go through this route, you are expected to be fully invested in the self learning route as well. If we are paraphrasing, you pay $13000 to someone else to teach yourself how to code. This sounds like a nonsense scam to me.

I believe education is the foundation of a strong, powerful society. I want to pay taxes for education so little Timmy across the street, whom I've never met, can get an education in public school. Why? Because I don't want the whole of society to be filled with uninformed, uneducated people. Claszroom is an attempt to take on this system and bring as much information together to educate those who want an education but can't afford it. All courses are written in markdown and stored on Github under the courses folder.

> Markdown is a text based format. This format makes it easy to read and easy to update. It allows us to easily compare what has been added, what has been deprecated, and what has been updated. If we stored the courses as PDF or Word formats, we wouldn't be able to easily diff the changes without proprietary software. Basically, Markdown, while a bit primitive, makes this available to everyone. Also, by storing all of the courses on GitHub, we have a community that can proof read and make changes to the content. The other reason is so that people can access the courses as long as they have access to the internet. If you are homeless with no money at all, you can still educate yourself by accessing a public library with internet access.

## Conclusion

The message for you at this point is to ask the question, "why?" Why are you doing what you are doing? Ask your boss why he needs this assignment done by some unreasonable date? Challenge the status quo if you don't believe that the path you're on is the right one. By doing this, you will give purpose to what you do and why you are doing it. It creates meaning for your output; you are much less likely to give up and quit when you are deeply invested in something. You should always start with the most important question of them all. Why?
